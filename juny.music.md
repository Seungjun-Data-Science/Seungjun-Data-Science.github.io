### JUNY

I do music as my side hustle. ***JUNY*** is my stagename! I have my own [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDBi2xuCCF4qNWCWfyIBUlQ) where I upload my music covers (English, Korean, Mandarin songs). <br>
I plan to release my first Mixtape/EP this year on various music platforms including Spotify, so stay tuned! :) <br>
I also play the drums. I was a drummer at my high school. If anyone is down for producing music for me, doing music collaborations with me etc., feel free to reach out!

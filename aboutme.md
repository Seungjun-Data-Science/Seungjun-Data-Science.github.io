## Hi folks!

![Me in London!](/assets/img/IMG_4301.jpg)

### Faith

I am a Christian who believes in the Holy Trinity. I trust and rely on God and Jesus Christ in whatever I do. <br>
***"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go." (Joshua 1:9)***

### Career

My name is Josh Kim (my Korean name is Seungjun Kim for those who are interested). I am currently working for the Criminal Justice Administrative Records (CJARS) which is a criminal justice research group at the University of Michiganâ€™s Institute for Social Research. <br>
I perform data cleaning, standardization and harmonization of various criminal justice data we collect from arrest, adjudication to incarceration, parole and probation records. For more information on what I do at CJARS, check the CV tab of this page! We often link such wrangled data with data coming from the U.S. Census Bureau, our partnership institution, to conduct criminal justice research. <br>
I am particularly passionate about Data Science for Social Good which refers to projects that leverage the power of data science to address various social issues. 

### Hobbies

I do music as my side hustle. I sing and play the drums. Not a professional musician yet but I am taking baby steps to grow as a musician.<br>
I have a Youtube Channel where I upload my music covers (I sing English, Korean and Mandarin songs!). I am planning to release a mixtape / EP this year featuring some original music on different music platforms including Spotify. Stay Tuned! <br><br>
Other things I love to do include cooking (especially Korean and Chinese food), body building, walking and hiking in nature, and watching K-dramas with friends (telepartttyyyyy! Thanks Netflix).
